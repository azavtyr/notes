**Docker** is a containerization platform by which you can have an isolated dev environment for building, sharing, and running applications with all its dependencies.

## Key Components of Docker

* **Docker Engine** is the core of Docker, that handles creation and management of containers.
* **Docker Image** is a snapshot of your application along with all of its dependencies. It can be used to create and run multiple containers.
* **Container** is your actual application with all its dependencies running in the real world.
* **Dockerfile** is an instruction file that describes the steps to create a Docker Image quickly.
