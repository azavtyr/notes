The key difference is that, instead of virtualizing hardware, containers only virtualize the OS (kernel). All apps or containers are run by a single kernel.

Containers are generally lightweight and small in size, for these reasons they perform better than VMs.

As with VMs, they are much bigger in size, generally in gigabytes, and take longer to run than containers.
