# Welcome!

> [!IMPORTANT] IMPORTANT NOTICE
> **This is a personal documentation.** It’s where I capture my learning process and document how I approach problems. Some content comes from **official sources**, some from **books**, some from **my own research**, and some from **hands-on experience** - all tailored to my setup and thinking. If you find it useful, that’s great.
>
> You might wonder why I share this if it’s mainly for myself. **Sharing my notes keeps me organized and serves as a backup of my work.** Plus, it may help others who find something useful here. But don’t expect a polished manual — *this is my personal tech journal, not a comprehensive guide.*

If you landed here from my portfolio — welcome again.

This is the technical heart of my site, where I focus on Linux, networking, virtualization, sysadmin tasks, programming, and everything in between. It’s where I keep detailed notes on what I’m learning, experimenting with, breaking, fixing, and rebuilding. Over time, it’s become my space for organizing configs, setups, and insights that future me will definitely need.

This isn’t polished or SEO-focused — it’s simply my way of keeping track of the complex stuff in a way that makes sense to me.

Treat it like an open notebook. Poke around. Steal configs, setups. Or just see how someone else learns by doing.
