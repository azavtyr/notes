I've recently discovered that GFM (also Obsidian and MkDocs) supports alerts which are a Markdown extension that you can use to emphasize important information.

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Test note
```

GFM supports five types of alerts:

- NOTE
- TIP
- IMPORTANT
- WARNING
- CAUTION

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice that helps user to do things better or more easily. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Information that needs user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
