# Why put code into a function in shell scripts?

Putting code into functions makes it easier to manage, especially when using editors like `vi`. One big benefit of doing this is that I can quickly cut and paste entire functions using commands like `dap` in `vi`, which deletes a full function block. This makes it easy to move or reuse the code elsewhere.

Using functions help by:

* Making code modular and reusable
* Reducing the need to depend on external scripts
* Keeping everything in one place, which simplifies maintenance
